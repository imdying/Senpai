# Maid
 
 [![NuGet Badge](https://buildstats.info/nuget/maid?includePreReleases=true)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/maid)

 A command-line assistant that handles the [command-line interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface#Command-line_interpreter) of your CLI applications. 
 
 Maid simplifies and abstracts away [System.CommandLine](https://github.com/dotnet/command-line-api) and presents a user-friendly-ish approach to defining and managing commands. 
 
 With Maid, developers can focus on their core functionality and avoid the hassle of dealing with declarations, whatever whatever, making it an ideal tool for streamlining the command-line development process.
