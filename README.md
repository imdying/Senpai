# Maid
 
 [![NuGet Badge](https://buildstats.info/nuget/maid?includePreReleases=true)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/maid)

 A command-line assistant that handles the [command-line interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface#Command-line_interpreter) of your CLI applications. 
 
 Maid abstracts away [System.CommandLine](https://github.com/dotnet/command-line-api) and presents a user-friendly-ish way to define and manage commands.
